### PLAN

- Compute shader or similar for placement
  - maybe an easier okayish-for-now solution is to just use the threejs geos and raycast against those
- UI that shows the blob tree
  - With some controls for adding/removing items
- materials
- different shapes
- different operations
- better lighting
